-- Exploratory Data Analysis

-- Here we are just going to explorethe data and find or petterns or anything interesting like outliers

-- Normally when you start the EDA process you have some ideas of what you're looking for

-- with this info we are just going to look around see what we find!

-- SKILL use : Aggregate Functions, CTE, Sorting,  Windows Function, Substring

-- EASIER QUERIES
-- Looking at percentage to see how big these layoffs were
